# Genetic painting 
**Description**
This is a 1 month large scale project on applied AI. We used genetic algorithm to generate a specific art style. 
<br> The work mainly consists of 
- conduct research on previous work
- writing a project proposal 
- writing, fine-tuning, modifying the actual genetic algorithm code specialized on art generation 
- documented the process of project, evaluation on results 
- conduct a presentation in front of 30-35 people 

## Files description
